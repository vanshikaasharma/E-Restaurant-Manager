# E-Restaurant Manager

This project proposes the design of a comprehensive Restaurant Management and Delivery System that combines functionalities for table reservations, customer ratings and reviews, restaurant and menu management, and food delivery services. The application will allow users to easily search for restaurants, view menus, make reservations, and leave a reviw or a rating based on their dining experiences for the other customers. Restaurant owners will have the ability to add new restaurants, manage their menus, and respond to customer reviews. Additionally, users will be able to order food for delivery, track their orders, and receive updates on delivery status.

The primary users of this application will include restaurant customers seeking a comfortable dining experience and restaurant owners looking to manage their establishments more effectively.


I chose the E-Restaurant Manager idea because I often find interesting restaurants online that are too far to visit. A convenient food ordering app would let me order directly from these places without the hassle of traveling. Sometimes, I consider ordering but realize the restaurant is close enough to visit. However, booking a table online can be tedious due to cumbersome website navigation. The E-Restaurant Manager solves these issues by offering a user-friendly platform that combines food ordering and table reservations, streamlining the dining experience and catering to diverse preferences for both dining in and ordering out.
